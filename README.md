## Course: CST8002 - Programming Language Research Project  
**Author:** Pawinee Mahantamak  
**Professor:** Stanley Pieda  
**Project Type:** Practical project
**Language:** Rust

## Project Overview
This project is a **Natural Gas Liquid Export Management System** that processes **CSV data**, supports **CRUD operations**, and follows the **N-Layered Architecture**.

### Key Features
**Reads data from CSV (up to 100 records initially)**  
**Stores data in memory and supports Add/Edit/Delete operations**  
**Displays records interactively with a command-line menu**  
**Saves updated data back to CSV (with a unique UUID filename)**  
**Implements error handling and unit testing**

## Practical 1: Initial Project Implementation
In **Practical 1**, the system was built with **basic functionality**:
1. **Defined the data model** (`NaturalGasLiquidExport`)
2. **Implemented CSV reading functionality**
3. **Displayed records from the dataset**
4. **Structured the project using Rust modules**


---

## Practical 2: Advanced Features & Architecture
In **Practical 2**, the project was refactored into a **fully structured N-Layered Architecture**, with added **CRUD functionality** and **user interaction**.

1. **Implemented N-Layered Architecture**  
2. **Created a CLI-based interactive menu**  
3. **Enabled adding, editing, and deleting records in memory**  
4. **Persisted data back to a CSV file using UUID filenames**  
5. **Implemented unit tests for core functions**
